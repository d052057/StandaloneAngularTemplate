The template is based upon VS2022, C# Dotnet 9.0, Angular v21.X.X, Bootstrap and Bootstrap-icons.  Home page is a bootstrap Nav bar.

To install it, download the source code and put them in source/repos.  From the windows powershell or cmd in source/repos/StandaloneAngularTemplate folder, TYPE:
```
dotnet new --install .
```
or
```
dotnet new install .
```

To uninstall it, from source/repos type
```
dotnet new uninstall StandaloneAngularTemplate.template
```
To create a new project from this template from source/repos type:
